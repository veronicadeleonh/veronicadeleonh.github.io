### About Mondly

**Mondly** is a language learning app that aims to make language learning fun and easy through technological innovation and multiple language combinations.

On 2022 Mondly got acquired by Pearson, giving the Product team a chance for a big redesign of Mondly's platform and web presence.

### My Role at Mondly

During my stay at Mondly, making **A/B tests** about the performance of the Old vs. the New Design was important to validate with data the development of the rebrand and plan the marketing strategies for this design transition.

Before I joined the team, the product designers put in place a detailed **design system** that served as base for all the future assets we developed on the way. I collaborated closely with one of my colleagues on the creation of a **style guide** in Notion, were we documented the details of the New Mondly Brand and its usage.

### Mondly Web & Marketing

With a major rebranding underway, we created brand guidelines based on our design system that we could extend into marketing materials. We conducted a series of **A/B tests** to compare the performance of the **new design versus the old one**, ensuring a positive impact on user engagement.

#### Redesigned Offer page

For this project, we adapted the app’s design system for use on a marketing landing page for the first time. This laid the foundation for a **scalable design system** tailored to **web marketing materials**, evolving with the team’s needs. It also enabled us to expand the style guide specifically for marketing designers, who would use it in areas such as social media campaign ideation.

<div class="box-notes yellow-background" style="margin-bottom:20px">
 The redesigned Offer page resulted in an increase in <strong>average time on page</strong> and a lower <strong>bounce rate</strong> compared to the original control version.</div>

#### App Store & Google Play images

In order to test the impact of the rebranding on the Stores, we initiated a project to extend the new brand to these images. The light mode was introduced after benchmarking research showed competitors favoring light backgrounds in their App Store images. We organized several **Design Team workshops** to develop a light version of our new brand, allowing us to include it in the **A/B testing.**

<div class="box-notes yellow-background" style="margin-bottom:20px"> Data showed a <strong>nearly 3% increase in App Store downloads</strong> with <strong>Mondly's Light theme</strong> version compared to the control and dark theme variants. With this percentage we met our OKRs for Q1 2024</div>

### Mondly Growth & Monetization

The Growth team initiated several **A/B tests** to **increase Premium Subscriptions**. We tested various strategies, including designing new banners, creating templates for seasonal campaigns, and making UX improvements to the Free Trial screen.

#### Seasonal Campaigns

Our user acquisition strategy used full-screen in-app ads to guide Free Trial users to the Subscription screen, offering them the opportunity to **activate a Premium account**.

<p class="photo-footnote">User conversion through in-app ads flow</p>

Our strategy used a default ad layout for all free users, which we then **customized for each seasonal sale**. This approach allowed us to create a flexible template, easily adapting key elements like colors and imagery to fit the seasonal theme.

<p class="photo-footnote">In-app ad layout created for the Spring Campaign. Images generated with Midjourney</p>

For the **Spring Campaign 2024**, we developed a new layout for the in-app ad and proposed two different background images. We launched both variants and conducted an **A/B/C test** alongside the current fallback.

 Results showed a slight increase of <strong>7% more 'Activate' taps</strong> with <strong>variant B performing better</strong>. Nearly <strong>2% of users</strong> who reached the Subscription screen proceeded with the<strong> App Store Drawer,</strong> moving further down the conversion funnel.
</div>

### Marketing Campaigns

One major ongoing marketing campaign involved creating an onboarding flow with a questionnaire that guided users to a payment screen. I was responsible for the design and UX of this flow. The biggest challenge was developing a style that seamlessly blended elements of both the old and new Mondly branding.

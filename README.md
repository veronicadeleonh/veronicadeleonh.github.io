## About me

I'm Verónica, a Product Designer based in Berlin. I enjoy creating data-driven interfaces and combining my design skills with a bit of coding. During my career, I have also worked closely in the areas of Marketing and Growth.

I enjoy being surrounded by talented people who push me to keep learning and help build an awesome team culture.

When I’m not working, I’m usually snapping analog photos, exploring new places, diving into science and nature books, or staying active with some sports.

## About this Web

When I'm not traveling, I design and build interfaces. I recently created a website to showcase my work as a Product Designer, highlighting key projects and milestones.
